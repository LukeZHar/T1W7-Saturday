# T1W7-Saturday

# Wildcard Arguments
- When you don't know how manya rguments to pass in a function 
- Non-keyword arguments: *args
- Keyword arguments: greet(fname="Luke", lname="Harris") **kwargs

# Modules
- One of the techniques for following DRY coding principles
- Group similar codes and functions together in a seperate file
- Solves the problem of code files being too lengthy and complex 
- Can be reused across several programs
- Python comes with a lot of modules as well, Pythons Standard Libary

# Packages
- Collection of modules
- Organise related modules under one directory
- Initialise a packages using __init__.py file

## Practical example
Task:
- Create a package for basic text processing with modules for:
    - counting words in a string.
    - Counting characters in a string.
    - Reversing strings.

# Slicing a sequence
- Way to extract parts of data structures, like strings, lists, tuples.
- Syntax: sequence[start:stop:step] (like range) range(1, 10)
- Default start: 0 
- Default step: 1
- Default stop: last

# Object Oriented Programming
- It is a way to help programmers structure the functionality of your program that would mnake sense to humans and would allow computers to run it efficiently.
- Almost all programming languages use this concept. 
- It uses "objects" to model real-world entities. 

## Key concepts 
- Class
    - Blueprint for creating objects.
    - Defines a set of attributes or methods that the created objects (instances) will have
    - E.g. Blueprint provided while building a house, defining what an animal is

- Object
    - An instance of a class
    - It represents a specific entity with attributes (data) and methods (functions) defined by class.
    - E.g. A built house with many features (as functions) 
    - E.g. class_eg(Dog)
    - E.g. BankAccount

- 4 pillars of OOp
- Encapulation, extraction, inheritance, polymorphism
